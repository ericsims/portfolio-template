## About
Candlefinder is a robot that was built to compete in the 2017 [Trinity College Fire Fighting Home Robot Competition](http://www.trincoll.edu/events/robot/).

It was awarded the IEEE Outstanding Robots from Connecticut Award.

## Design
Candlefinder has a unique 3-wheel "vector drive" which allows the robot to immediately roll in any direction without rotating its base. It relies on the RPLidar and SLAM localization to autonomously navigate a maze, and a USB camera with OpenCV to locate the candle. The robot uses a CO2 system to extinguish candle flames.
